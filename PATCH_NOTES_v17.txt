KKPoker_Solver v11 â€” Main Logo Center Patch (v17)
-------------------------------------------------
- Injected 'reghuterz-hatternelkul_1.png' and wired the Main page to show it
  in large size, centered. The LogoWidget uses Expanding size policy and smooth scaling.

Files changed:
- app/main.py  (size policy tweak for LogoWidget)
- reghuterz-hatternelkul_1.png  (added at project root and /app/)

How it works:
- On startup the Home tab creates LogoWidget which searches for the PNG in:
  ../reghuterz-hatternelkul_1.png, ./app/reghuterz-hatternelkul_1.png,
  and CWD. The file is now present in the first two locations in this package.

Requested by user: center and enlarge the provided logo on the main page.
